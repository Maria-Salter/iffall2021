        <p>1. Provide your name, major, year in school.</p> 
            <p>I'm Maria Salter, and I'm a junior in Communication Design.</p>
        <p>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</p>
            <p>I'm from Colorado, and came to this school to learn more about visual arts and creative writing. This class is required for Communication Design, but to be honest I might have taken the class on my own.</p>
        <p>3. Do you have any experience with HTML, CSS, or JS? If so, tell us about it. <p>
            <p>Some of my other ComDes classes have desperately tried to get me to learn coding, specifically JS. So far not much information has stuck, but maybe this class will be different. This si the first time I've ever properly worked in HTML (I tried once in the past and failed miserably).</p>
        <p>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</p>
            <p>At the very least I want to have a better understanding of the vocabulary and basics of coding, so that I can reasonably follow a conversation about one without completely blanking.</p>
        <p>5. Name one way you expect designing for a screen to be different from designing for paper.</p>
            <p>With designing on paper, it's a far more direct interaction to draw or type something. With coding, everything is more roundabout and tedious in a way that just isn't intuitive for me.</p>
        <p>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</p>
            <p>https://archiveofourown.org/</p>
            <p>The site has a better tagging system than many professional settings, and currently holds over six million works. It's run by a nonprofit organization and is managed by volunteers.</p>
        <p>7. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</p>
            <p>https://www.webtoons.com/en/</p>
            <p>Has an excellent and easily navigated system that can organize works by both genre as well as when in the week they're updated. It also easily and clearly showcases both new and popular stories on the site, as well as a featured at the top of the page that is really nice to look at (having nice illustrations to show off doesn't hurt). </p>
        <p>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</p>
            <p>https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r</p>
            <p>Not only is the layout of the calendar very well designed and simple, its connections to your email allows for automatic placement on the calendar for appointments made through the email. Moreover, the detailed customization with scheduling makes it painfully easy to use.</p>
