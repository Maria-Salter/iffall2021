        <h2>Mystery Cake</h2>
        <aside>Source: The Joy of Cooking</aside>
        <h3>Considered an easy to make spice cake with an unusal ingrediant to help make it moist: tomato soup.</h3>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <aside>2 cups sifted flour</aside>
            <aside>1 teaspoon baking soda</aside>
            <aside>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</aside>
            <aside>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</aside>
            <aside>1/2 teaspoon ground cloves</aside>
            <aside>1/2 teaspoon salt</aside>
            <aside>1/4 cup unsalted butter</aside>
            <aside>1 cup sugar</aside>
            <aside>1 ten and three-quarter can condensed tomato soup</aside>
            <aside>1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans</aside>
            <aside>1 cup raisins</aside>
        <p>For the Frosting (Optional)</p>
            <aside>8 ounces cream cheese, chilled</aside>
            <aside>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</aside>
            <aside>2 teaspoons vanilla</aside>
            <aside>3 cups confectioners sugar, sifted</aside>
            <aside>Grated lemon or orange zest</aside>
        <p>Instructions: </p>
            <aside>1.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a nine inch square baking pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt.</aside>
            <aside>2.   Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on high speed until well combined, 3 to 5 minutes. </aside>
            <aside>3.   On low speed, beat in the flour mixture in 3 parts, alternating with the tomato soup in 2 parts. Fold in the nuts and raisins. </aside>
            <aside>4.   Spread the batter into the pan and smooth the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan on a rack.</aside>
            <aside>5. If you choose to make the frosting, combine the cream cheese, butter, vanilla, and sugar in the bowl of a mixer and mix until just smooth and creamy. If the frosting is too stiff, beat for a few seconds longer, being careful not to overbeat it. If you choose, stir in the zest.</aside>
            <aside>6. To serve, remove the cake from the pan and either sprinkle with powdered sugar or cover with the frosting.</aside>
        <p>         </p>

        <h1>Recipe Websites</h1>
            
        <h3><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/?action=click&module=nav&region=logo&pgType=recipe-page">New York Times Cooking Section</a></h3>
        <p>The site I used to find the mystery cake. Very efficiently spaced so there is minimal scrolling, all relevant information is easy to find, and reviews and recommendations have various categories based on usefulness.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">AllRecipes.com</a></h3>
        <p>Allows for the ingredients list to have a serving number inserted so it can automatically adjust, and there is a box next to each ingredient for you to checkmark while shopping. The site also allows anyone to share whatever recipes they find.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/">KingArthurBaking.com</a></h3>
        <p>Though interactions are quite simple, the layout and design of the website--and especially the recipes--are extremely elegant and an excellent example of hierarchy with typography. Also provides a "Baker's Hotline" that allows you to chat with a professional baker for advice, as well as a list of helpful guides to read yourself.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Non-Recipe Websites</h1>
        <h3><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/">DeviantArt.com</a></h3>
        <p>A site mainly for sharing artworks, the front page provides a large selection of some of the latest and most popular artworks. The text is small and unobtrusive, with a simple font to be easily visible. Mousing over artwork gives you the name of the artist.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.mixbook.com/?source=montage&utm_source=montage">MixBook.com</a></h3>
        <p>Text put in a lot of different places, but doesn't come across as too cluttered. Prompted to get started at the beginning, and if you don't you can scroll through to get an introduction to the product before being prompted to get started again. Good flow.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://boostedusa.com/">BoostedUSA</a></h3>
        <p>Has similar strengths to MixBook, though one thing that caught my attention was the transformation of images as the mouse scrolled over them. Adds more dynamic movement to the interaction.</p>
